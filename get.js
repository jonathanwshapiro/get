I’ll have you know I graduated top of my burrow in the Navy Snakes, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on chicken nests, and I have over 300 confirmed bites. I am trained in constrictor warfare and I’m the top viper in the entire US scaled forces. You are nothing to me but just another feeding. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been tasted before on this Earth, mark my fucking fangs. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of snakes across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, frozen mouse. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, eggo. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare fangs. Not only am I extensively trained in UNARMED combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Snake Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy constriction your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, tadpole.", event.thread_id);
